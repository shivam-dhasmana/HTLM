  <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in
     Earth's average surface temperature due to human 
     activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases
      such as carbon dioxide and methane.<strong> These gases trap 
      heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in 
      temperatures across the globe </strong>. As a result, glaciers are 
      melting, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather
       events like heatwaves, droughts, and floods are 
       becoming more frequent and intense. The burning 
       of fossil fuels, deforestati clear
       on, and industrial 
       pollution are major contributors to this crisis. 
       If not addressed, global warming poses a serious 
       threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and human life. 
       Urgent action through sustainable practices, renewable
        energy, and international cooperation is essential 
        to combat its effects and protect the planet for 
        future generations.</p>
